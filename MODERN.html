                <p><em>The Wii,</em>  released in 2006, was by no means a powerhouse of a system, continuing to run games at the same resolution and framerate as the Gamecube of 480p or 480i, behind the competition of the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3's 1080p.
                On the surface, this seemed a bad decision to make a brand new console effectively equivalent with last generations technical specs, however <strong>Nintendo</strong> had two secrets hidden up their sleeves. 
                An almost never ending lineup of exclusive games including <em>Wii Play, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.</em>
                All of these games easily accessible controls that could be used by anyone aged five to ninety-five, and many games were new iterations on previous franchises such as 
               <em>Punchout, Donkey Kong Country Returns and Super Mario Galaxy</em> made it a no brainer purchase for players of these franchises who played iterations on the <em>Nintendo Entertainment System</em> and <em> Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</em></p>

                <p><em>The Nintendo Switch,</em> released in 2017 was the first ever 'hybrid' console, being able to be played on a small, inbuilt 5.5 inch diagonal display or plugged in to a external display with the included dock.
                Even though this console isn't even a decade old currently, (It is getting close...) it was until a couple of months ago Nintendo's latest console, and it already has affected the way gaming hardware is designed.<br><br>
                The design of a console with 1 stick, 4 buttons and 2 triggers on the left and right with a screen in between, started with the <em>Switch's</em>  two detachable controllers, named "Joy-Cons" that when not attached could act similiarly to Wii remotes in multiplayer titles such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or as motion controllers for titles such as Nintendo Switch Sports.
                The controller design of 4 buttons, 8 cardinal directions and two triggers also allows for multiplayer in Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System games on the Nintendo Switch Online service and could be played connected to the system, detached from the system and leaving it on a table or plugging it into the dock to use it on a moniter.
                This design philisophy was carried into recently released PC handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go.
                All three of these consoles contain 2 sticks, four face buttons, one d-pad, two menu buttons and two sets of triggers and are all more graphically than the <em>Switch</em>, but the Steam deck has two touch pads on each side that can be used as a mice for certain games that would be more optimal, such as real time strategy games, tower defence games and first/third person shooter games.
                The ROG Ally had improved specs from the Steam deck, but the most noteworthy is the Lenovo Legion Go, with an 8 inch diagonal display and detachable controllers that can not only be used to game on a table in the way the <em>Switch</em> can, the right controller can be put into a small accessory that allows for full mouse to hold, rather than a traditional joystick, a motion controlled gyroscope or the Steam Deck's inch sized trackpads which would make games in the three genres I mentioned before.
                <br><br>Despite what the <em>Switch</em> started with the PC handheld industry, the device itself is still quite powerful considering when it was released and the small, convenient form factor it came in.
                Often games that released earlier in the <em>Switch's</em> lifespan and especially titles developed or published by Nintendo got better performance, such as the console's major launch title, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
                Releasing March 3rd, 2017 on Wii U and <em>Switch</em>, the latter being far more impressive as instead of being on a "portable" system that could be taken across your house depending on how the controller's connection was feeling that day and tethered to a large and bulky home console, it was on a fully fledged portable system that could last a solid couple hours running intense 3D AAA games
